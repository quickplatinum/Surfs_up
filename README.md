# Surfs Up: Weather Patterns Analysis
##  Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview and Purpose

The prospective owner of an Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii is worried that his shop will be poorly situated in Oahu. He wants to make sure the weather patterns in the area are in line with sunny ice cream and surf conditions. Wavy is the name of the boss, and the job is clear, evaluate weather patterns in June and December and compare them. Taking data from these months of summer and winter opposites and analysing them.

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

## Results and Analysis

### June Results, Shown in the table below for Oahu:

### December Results, Shown in the table below for Oahu:

### Key differences between weather in June and December:
1. The mean in December is slighlty lower than in June, the mean in June is 75 while in December it drops to 71. This change is rather small for two polar opposite times of the year, one in winter and the other in summer. A 4 degree difference is not that vast for the purpose of openiong the shop and the temperature remains warm.
2. Another interesting point would be the maximum temperature, a difference of only 2 degrees between December which is at 83 and June which is at 85, meaning the months follow similiar patterns.
3. The biggest difference would be the minimium temperature, in June it is at 64 and in December it is at 56. Which does indicate temperatures tend to be lower at times in Decemeber.
 

## Summary and Additional Queries

From the data gathered we can see that opening an Ice cream and surfing shop in Oahu is a good idea, an educated analysis of these statistics indicates that all year round the variation of weather patterns in Oahu is minimial. and that temperatures average in the mid 70's even when comparing two very different months of June and December. I reccommend Wavy opens his shop with no fear.

Some additonal queries may include:
1. An additional query measuring the difference in wind patterns between these months would have made sense for surfing and to make sure its not too windy or still in Oahu in certain months. 
2. It would have been good to analyze day time temperature exlcusively, the data we gathered reflects the entire day and night average, however we are only interested in the day time when people will be up and about buying ice cream and surfing.
